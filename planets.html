      <h2>Force of Gravity on planets</h2>
<br>      
        <br>
        <div>
      <span>
          <h1>Mercury</h1>
      <img class="img2" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Mercury_in_color_-_Prockter07-edit1.jpg/1200px-Mercury_in_color_-_Prockter07-edit1.jpg">
          <h2 class="h2planets">With a mean radius of about 2,440 km and a mass of 3.30 × 1023 kg, Mercury is approximately 0.383 times the size of Earth and only 0.055 as massive. This makes Mercury the smallest and least massive planet in the solar system. However, thanks to its high density – a robust 5.427 g/cm3, which is just slightly lower than Earth's 5.514 g/cm3 – Mercury has a surface gravity of 3.7 m/s2, which is the equivalent of 0.38 g.</h2>
      </span>
          
          <span>
              <h1>Venus</h1>
      <img class="img2" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/PIA23791-Venus-NewlyProcessedView-20200608.jpg/220px-PIA23791-Venus-NewlyProcessedView-20200608.jpg">
          <h2 class="h2planets">Venus is similar to Earth in many ways, which is why it is often referred to as "Earth's twin". With a mean radius of 4.6023×108 km2, a mass of 4.8675×1024 kg, and a density of 5.243 g/cm3, Venus is equivalent in size to 0.9499 Earths, 0.815 times as massive, and roughly 0.95 times as dense. Hence, it is no surprise why the gravity on Venus is very close to that of Earth's – 8.87 m/s2, or 0.904 g.</h2>
      </span>
          
          <span>
              <h1>Mars</h1>
      <img class="img2" src="https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/19111442/pia00407.jpg">
          <h2 class="h2planets">Mars is also similar to Earth in many key respects. However, when it comes to size, mass and density, Mars is comparatively small. In fact, its mean radius of 3.389 km is the equivalent of roughly 0.53 Earths, while its mass (6.4171×1023 kg) is just 0.107 Earths. Its density, meanwhile, is about 0.71 of Earths, coming in at a relatively modest 3.93 g/cm3. Because of this, Mars has 0.38 times the gravity of Earth, which works out to 3.711 m/s2.</h2>
      </span>
          
          <span>
              <h1>Jupiter</h1>
      <img class="img2" src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2015/1-howstrongisg.jpg">
          <h2 class="h2planets">Jupiter is the largest and most massive planet in the solar system. Its mean radius, at 69,911 ± 6 km, makes it 10.97 the times the size of Earth, while its mass (1.8986×1027 kg) is the equivalent of 317.8 Earths. But being a gas giant, Jupiter is naturally less dense than Earth and other terrestrial planets, with a mean density of 1.326 g/cm3.</h2>
      </span>
          
          <span>
              <h1>Saturn</h1>
      <img class="img2" src="http://astronomy.com/~/media/8869F96544004BA298FE10708769601D.jpg">
          <h2 class="h2planets">Like Jupiter, Saturn is a huge gas giant that is significantly larger and more massive than Earth, but far less dense. In short, its mean radius is 58232±6 km (9.13 Earths), its mass is 5.6846×1026 kg (95.15 times as massive), and has a density of 0.687 g/cm3. As a result, its surface gravity (again, measured from the top of its clouds) is just slightly more than Earth's, which is 10.44 m/s2 (or 1.065 g).</h2>
      </span>
          
          <span>
              <h1>Uranus</h1>
      <img class="img2" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cnu0m8re1exe/7hQBr1Got3iOOxCn4yJqSy/8ac59ceb4d08d0474a2688ac976b1693/neptune1-1024x727.jpg?w=650&h=433&fit=fill">
          <h2 class="h2planets">With a mean radius of 25,360 km and a mass of 8.68 × 1025 kg, Uranus is approximately 4 times the size of Earth and 14.536 times as massive. However, as a gas giant, its density (1.27 g/cm3) is significantly lower than Earth's. Hence, why its surface gravity (measured from its cloud tops) is slightly weaker than Earth's – 8.69 m/s2, or 0.886 g.</h2>
      </span>
          
          <span>
              <h1>Neptune</h1>
      <img class="img2" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS7WO87bSM0gxzo08mtvrequ58DANEY0lNFQQ&usqp=CAU">
          <h2 class="h2planets">With a mean radius of 24,622 ± 19 km and a mass of 1.0243×1026 kg, Neptune is the fourth largest planet in the solar system. All told, it is 3.86 times the size of Earth and 17 times as massive. But, being a gas giant, it has a low density of 1.638 g/cm3. All of this works out to a surface gravity of 11.15 m/s2 (or 1.14 g), which again is measured at Neptune's cloud tops.</h2>
