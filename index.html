    <h2>Gravity was discovered by:-</h2>
    <h3>Isaac Newton</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Isaac Newton was the first scientist to discover gravity. Gravity is the force that pulls an object to the surface of the earth. This force exists on every planet but the amount of gravity is much higher on earth. Gravity, also called gravitation, in mechanics, the universal force of attraction acting between all matter. On Earth all bodies have a weight, or downward force of gravity, proportional to their mass, which Earth's mass exerts on them. Gravity is measured by the acceleration that it gives to freely falling objects.</p>
